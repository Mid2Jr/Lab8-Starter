graceful degradation is making sure that the software remains usable under limited network performances and even if some resources fail to laod. And service workers is similar to the idea of graceful degradation since they run in the background and caches what was previously loaded so user can access the same things even when network problems occur, which provides same functionality as graceful degradation where under limited resource the product can still be used.
